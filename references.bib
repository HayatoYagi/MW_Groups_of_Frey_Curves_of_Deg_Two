  abstract = {We study the family of elliptic curves y² = x(x-a²)(x-b²) parametrized by Pythagorean triples (a,b,c). We prove that for a generic triple the lower bound of the rank of the Mordell-Weil group over ℚ is 1, and for some explicitly given infinite family the rank is 2. To each family we attach an elliptic surface fibered over the projective line. We show that the lower bounds for the rank are optimal, in the sense that for each generic fiber of such an elliptic surface its corresponding Mordell-Weil group over the function field ℚ(t) has rank 1 or 2, respectively. In order to prove this, we compute the characteristic polynomials of the Frobenius automorphisms acting on the second ℓ -adic cohomology groups attached to elliptic surfaces of Kodaira dimensions 0 and 1.},

  abstract = {A rational triangle is a triangle with rational sides and rational area. A Heron triangle is a triangle with integral sides and integral area. In this article we will show that there exist infinitely many rational parametrizations, in terms of s, of rational triangles with perimeter 2s(s+1) and area s(s2−1). As a corollary, there exist arbitrarily many Heron triangles with all the same area and the same perimeter. The proof uses an elliptic K3 surface Y. Its Picard number is computed to be 18 after we prove that the Néron–Severi group of Y injects naturally into the Néron–Severi group of the reduction of Y at a prime of good reduction. We also give some constructions of elliptic surfaces and prove that under mild conditions a cubic surface in P3 can be given the structure of an elliptic surface by cutting it with the family of hyperplanes through a given line L. Some of these constructions were already known, but appear to have lacked proof in the literature until now.}
