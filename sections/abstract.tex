    We study a family of elliptic curves $y^2 = x (x - a^2)(x+b^2)$, where $(a,b,c)$ are Pythagorean triples.
    This is the family of the Frey curves of degree $2$.
    We can one-parameterize Pythagorean triples by rational numbers and consider the family as an elliptic curve over a function field.
    \begin{equation*}
        E_{1,s}: y^{2} = x(x - 4s^{2})(x + (s^{2} - 1)^{2})
    \end{equation*}

    It is known that the generic rank of the Mordell-Weil group of $E_{1,s}$ over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}(s)$ is $0$.
    We found an infinite subfamily of $E_{1,s}$ whose Mordell-Weil rank over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}(s)$ is $1$, which means that there are infinitely many $s \in \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ such that the Mordell-Weil group of $E_{1,s}$ has positive rank over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$.

    We use the theory of elliptic surfaces to prove it.
    Each elliptic curve over a function field corresponds to an elliptic surface.
    The Shioda-Tate formula gives the relation between the Mordell-Weil rank and the \Neron-Severi rank of elliptic surfaces.
    We compute the types of special fibers of the elliptic surfaces and consider an upper bound of the rank of the \Neron-Severi group.

    It is relatively easy to prove that the generic rank of the subfamily is less than $2$.
    In order to prove that the generic rank is exactly $1$, we calculate the characteristic polynomial of the action of the Frobenius automorphism on the second $l$-adic \'etale cohomology group using Lefschetz fixed point theorem to get the sharp upper bound of the rank of the \Neron-Severi group.
