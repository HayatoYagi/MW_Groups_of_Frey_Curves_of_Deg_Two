\section*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my professor Masato Kurihara for his guidance and encouragement.
I also could not have undertaken this journey without the support of Dr. Bartosz NaskrÄ™cki.
He has politely answered my many emails with questions and given me valuable advice.
